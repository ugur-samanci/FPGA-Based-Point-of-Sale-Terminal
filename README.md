# FPGA-Based-Point-of-Sale-Terminal

The aim of the project is to design and implement a Point of Sale (POS) terminal using FPGA boards, which will be used by cashiers and waiters in markets and restaurants. The POS terminal will include a main screen designed using the VGA interface, with items being listed, images of items being sold, and a shopping list with prices. The operator side of the POS terminal will include buttons to input information about items being purchased and their quantities, with auto-complete functionality to highlight related items. The device will also include interactive modes that can be selected using switches, such as navigating above images or through the shopping list, and a cancel button to delete the selected item from the current shopping list. The goal of the project is to create a functional and user-friendly POS terminal that will make it easier for cashiers and waiters to complete transactions.
